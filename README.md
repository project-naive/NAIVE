# NAIVE

A simple c++ multi-purpose (game) engine framework.  

## Rationale

This project is primarily aimed at  
- Contructing a robust engine from scratch to learn more about program design and how stuff actually work within a given engine
- Optimize and provide a robust extensible framework for games
- Provide a framework of configurable setup available for future use in other programs including but not limited to GPGPU, etc.
- An open source, free-to-use and cross-platform game engine, although limited in functionality, may be helpful to indie developers.
