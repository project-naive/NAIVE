3. OpenGL API and GLSL resources
	3.1 Learn OpenGL tutorial site (offline book available)
		https://learnopengl.com/
	3.2 OpenGL Book (offline book available)
		http://openglbook.com/
	3.3 OpenGL registry documentation

	3.4 A simple guide to a simple engine
		http://in2gpu.com/2014/10/15/setting-up-opengl-with-visual-studio/

4. Model tranformations, general computer graphics
	4.1 Material source from a professor account I found on Github
		https://github.com/alecjacobson

5. Network socket programming
	(Not many, not especially good...)
	5.1 Microsoft's Winsock has documentation here
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/WinSock/windows-sockets-start-page-2
	5.2 recommended material Beej's guide
		http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/single/bgnet.html

6. Possible Audio Library
	6.1 OpenAL (in a somewhat static situation)
		https://www.openal.org/
	6.2 FMOD (expensived despite being powerful... reconsider...?)
		http://www.fmod.org/
	6.3 FFmpeg (LGPLed, can be bad for a commercial project in the future, defaut distributed binary is under GPLv3)
		https://ffmpeg.org
	(There's not many free or MIT or BSD licensed API or libraries out there... OpenAL may be the most suitable...)
	(Considering using vorbis as default format)
	
7. Video codec
	(The situation is worse than Audio, and may require calling hardware apis to encode and decode... Software
	implementation is not fast enough in many cases.)
	7.1 x264/x265
	7.2 OpenH264
		https://github.com/cisco/openh264
