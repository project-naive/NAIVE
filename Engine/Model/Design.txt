Models have to be decoupled from graphics itself. And a model loading part shoud be
present, so this needs to be finished after the streaming and buffer implementation
is done.

Models by themselves should be able to contain more info than just mesh and texture.

Models should be able to be subdivided into the major part and smaller sub-parts, 
forming a tree data structure in the same model space, and subparts may be optional 
when intensive rendering, and should also be able to specify whether the tree has
significant parts in the following leaves. An idea is to give a weight to all the
parts and specify the part's weight and the largest weight of all its successor nodes.

Models parts should be able to be molded and controlled with a skeleton.
